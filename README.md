# Welcome, Nerds!

I'm t-88, and this is where I store my projects and share my code. I enjoy software development, including Flutter, Android, web development, and making apps using SFML/SDL for fun, graphics development, game development, and I'm interested in learning as much as possible about the world of computer science.

If you have any interesting ideas or need a team member, feel free to ask me.
